                <h1>Introduction</h1>                
                <p>
                  Around 7 years ago I decided to teach myself how to code and make a trading bot for a popular online video game. This game has a complex economy and a global exchange system similar in many ways to the real stock market. It started out as a simple program but over the years I added a back-end, a control panel and a data analytics dashboard.

                <p id="technology">This project was built using Python, MySQL, PHP, Javascript, HTML, CSS, PowerBI, Linux, Free Pascal and a bit of Java

                <h1>The Bot</h1>
                
                <p>
                   The bot itself is coded in a language called Free Pascal. It's a rather obscure language that was part of a scripting engine that I chose to use 7 years ago for reasons that made sense to me at the time. The language itself could be considered to be somewhere between Java and C++ in terms of abstraction.

                <h2>Avoiding Detection</h2>

                <p>
                  The biggest challenge is not automating the various UIs, but it is to do so in a human-like way as to avoid detection. 
                  When we use interfaces there is a lot of randomness in our actions. We might pause midway to change our playlist or respond to a text. Whatever it may be, it creates natural variation. We also don't click static coordinates on the screen, etc. I wanted the bot to reflect these facts.
                  <br><br>
                  Another challenge was to make sure that the bot wouldn't get caught in an infinite feedback loop or do something suspicious. I had to come up with
                  a fail safe system that would cover all of the edge cases and unpredictable events. If the bot is unable to get back on track it will terminate to avoid doing something suspicious.
                </p>  
                <p id="configuration"></p>
                <h2>Configuration</h2>
                <p>
                  I came up with a configuration system to make every instance of the bot unique in a way that aims to bypass advanced comparative analysis. Almost every aspect of the behaviour is customizable. The mouse movement, the reaction time, the typing speed, etc. Every bot is behaving as if they are a different person.
                  <br><br>
                  For example, here is the configuration that controls the typing behaviour:
                  <br><br>
                  <img src="const.png" style="">
                </p>
                
                <p id="distributions"></p>
                <h2>Statistical Distributions</h2>
                <p>
                  I made sure to add the possibility for random delays between actions. However, using a simple random range would make the distributions look unnaturally uniform, so I used normal distributions (bell curve) by default. 
                  <br><br>
                  <span>
                    <img src="uniform.png" style="margin:0">
                    <img src="normal.png" style="margin-left:-2x">
                  </span>
                </p>
                <p>
                  I often found myself making instruments to record my own data and picking a mean and Std Dev
                  based on what I found, sometimes using the Python package matplotlib to make simple vizualisations.
                  <br><br>
                  <img src="viz2.png" style="width:100%;">
                </p>
                <p>
                  Every click target is defined as a box. The bot rolls a random point inside the box following normal distribution which creates a bias toward the center. The density translates to click accuracy, which can also be adjusted in the configuration.

                  This project is using a MySQL database. Every trade, including failed attempts, are stored in the <code>flips</code> table and include
                  the unix timestamp, the profit and the ID of the item and bot who performed the trade.<br><br>
                  Here is a relationship diagram I made:

                  This project is using a simple PHP RESTful API to allow the bot to access market insights established by the tracker along with posting closed trades.<br><br>
                  For example, to get the low or high margin value of an item currently being tracked, the request would go as follows:
                </p>
                <div style="font-size: 1.3em;background-color:#121821;padding:5px;margin-left:40px;margin-bottom:30px;display:inline-block;">

                </div>
                <br>
                <p>
                  To post a closed trade the request would go as follows:
                </p> 
                <div style="font-size: 1.3em;background-color:#121821;padding:5px;margin-left:40px;margin-bottom:30px;display:inline-block;">
                  <code>

                    -H 'Content-Type: application/json'
                    -d '{"profit":9999,"amount":1,"time_active":84,"item_id":22124,"acc_id":9}'

                  The tracker is a Python script that makes use of a public third party API containing live market data. It applies a series of
                  custom algorithms to analyze market movements and find patterns.<br><br>
                  As of writing, there are 94 items that are flagged as <em>flippable</em> in the database:

                <!--p>The reason why I need a "flippable" column is because every item that is currently active on any bot needs to continue being tracked regardless of whether it is still profitable or not.</p-->

              <h2 id="controlpanel">Control Panel</h2>

              <p>
                Around 4 years ago I decided to make a control panel that would allow me to monitor every test server and send commands to them. Before that I had to SSH into every server every time I wanted to check on them, so this was a big time saver.
              </p>
              <img src="controlpanel1.png" style="width:100%"><br><br>
              <p>
                Each tile represents a server. You can click on it to expand and see the latest screenshot and send basic commands e.g. start, stop, restart.
              </p>
              <img src="controlpanel2.png" style="width:100%">
              <h2 id="dashboard">Data Analysis</h2>

              <p>
                I eventually started learning tools like PowerBI, Tableau and a bit of R. I was quickly able to gain valuable insights from my visualizations.
              </p>
              <img src="dashboard.png" style="width:100%">

              <h1 id="finalnote">Final Note</h1>
              <p>
                This project is what initially got me into programming many years ago and I could not have hoped for a better learning experience. I especially enjoyed developing data analytics solutions and getting insights that actually allowed me to optimize my setup.
